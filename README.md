# ankinator

This repository is an early incarnation of an app to connect a Google Spreadsheet to an Anki deck. The project now runs on Elixir and Gleam, so this repo is archived.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run ./src/main.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.26. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
